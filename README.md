### What I learned

This project was a test of the knowledge I had just gained on consuming APIs and its functionality in general. I really enjoyed building this project, as it confirmed the knowledge I gained from the tutorials I watched on asynchronous JavaScript and APIs.


### Continued development

I am definitely looking forward to working with APIs and similar technologies in future projects to gain a better understanding of the many great things I can accomplish with them.


### Useful resources

- [Net ninja: async Js](https://www.example.com) - This helped me understand asynchronous JavaScript and how it works under the hood. It provided me with a solid foundation, and I recommend this video to anyone who is new to asynchronous JavaScript.
- [Net ninja: JSON-server](https://www.example.com) - This is also an amazing video. This tutorial walks you through all the processes of consuming an API and using the data obtained to manipulate the DOM. It was indeed a plus for me.
